## Run it yourself

### Getting started
First, clone this repository by running in your command prompt / terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/bethereumproject/bounty-lottery
```

### Generating the seed
The Block number used to generate the lottery seed will be: `8001600`. This block number is a number of an unmined block on the Ethereum Main chain. To make this lottery truly randomized and unpredictable we're using a block number which hasn't been mined yet! You can verify this by checking the timestamp of the edit when the block number was announced.

### Additional seed for the grand prize winner
The Block number used to generate the grand prize winner seed will be: `8026790`.
