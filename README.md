## Run it yourself

### Getting started
First, clone this repository by running in your command prompt / terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/bethereumproject/bounty-lottery
```

### Generating the seed
The Block number used to generate the lottery seed will be: `8001600`. This block number is a number of an unmined block on the Ethereum Main chain. To make this lottery truly randomized and unpredictable we're using a block number which hasn't been mined yet! You can verify this by checking the timestamp of the edit when the block number was announced.

Based on the Block number [8001600](https://etherscan.io/block/8001600), the seed generated for this lottery round was:	

```	
46731062094606958382869405966802844049179059481449912994227643743129127551707	
```	

### Running the lottery	
Navigate into the repository (using `cd` in command prompts / terminal) and run the following command with the correct seed generated by our smart contract:	

 ```python	
python lottery.py <seed> > results.json   # Replace <seed> with seed generated in the line above for the Gaming Contest lottery winners.	
```	

This will store the lottery outcome to the `results.json` file in your repository. 	

### Validating results	
You can validate that the file is identical to ours by running:	

 ```	
cat results.json | | md5sum	
```	

The output should be: `2ad7bb7fd4f1b100650300369244f797`
