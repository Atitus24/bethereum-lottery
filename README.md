# Lottery

To run the lottery, make sure you are on a Unix system with Python 2.7 installed.

First, clone this repository by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/bethereumproject/lottery
```

Navigate into the repository and run the following command with the correct seed generated by our smart contract:

```
python lottery.py 24720320868029256831056980548599233276942548680731582133364369473456750647913 > winners.json
```

The winners.json file should now contain the results of the lottery. To check that your generated result matches ours, simply run:

```
cat winners.json | md5sum
```

The output should be: `0773e8c356e4575581363544e8f56018`
