# Lottery

To run the lottery, make sure you are on a Unix system with Python 2.7 installed.

First, clone this repository by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/bethereumproject/bounty-lottery
```

Navigate into the repository and run the following command with the correct seed generated by our smart contract:

```
python lottery.py <seed> > results.json
```

This will store the lottery outcome to the `results.json` file. You can check that the file is identical to ours by running:

```
cat results.json | | md5sum
```

The output should be: `Unknown Yet`
