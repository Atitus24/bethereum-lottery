# Lottery

To run the lottery, make sure you are on a Unix system with **Python 2.7** installed. For a guide on how to install Python 2.7, click on your respective operating system:
- [MacOS](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install/osx/)
- [Linux](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install/linux/)

## Run it yourself

### Getting started
First, clone this repository by running in your command prompt / terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/bethereumproject/bounty-lottery
```

### Generating the seed
The Block number used to generate the lottery seed will be: `6969000`. This block number is a number of an unmined block on the Ethereum Main chain. To make this lottery truly randomized and unpredictable we're using a block number which hasn't been mined yet! You can verify this by checking the timestamp of the edit when the block number was announced.


To figure out how to generate the block number by yourself navigate into [this repository](https://github.com/bethereumproject/bounty-lottery/tree/master/smart_contracts). You'll find the Smart Contract used for the generation of the random seed there! *- Yes randomized by the blockchain*

Based on the Block number [6969000](https://etherscan.io/block/6969000), the seed generated for this lottery round was:

```
87932332748413526209302801506169340984733887229688644912856021103789043835462
```

### Running the lottery
Navigate into the repository (using `cd` in command prompts / terminal) and run the following command with the correct seed generated by our smart contract:

```python
python lottery.py <seed> > results.json   # Replace <seed> with seed generated in the line above for the Gaming Contest lottery winners.
```

This will store the lottery outcome to the `results.json` file in your repository. 

### Validating results
You can validate that the file is identical to ours by running:

```
cat results.json | | md5sum
```

The output should be: `4b2594d9f4449a1869695dcbf1a7aa63`
